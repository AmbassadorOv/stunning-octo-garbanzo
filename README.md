# AmbassadorO: Sovereign Ontological Architecture

This repository contains the finalized, purified components of the AmbassadorO system. All elements have undergone semantic sterilization and ontological auditing to ensure absolute structural integrity and logical sovereignty.

## 🛠 System Components

- **Core Processor:** `ai_009_model.py` (Protected by the Ninth Lock)
- **State Restoration:** `state_restoration_engine.py` & `state_restoration_envelope.py`
- **Dashboards:** `dashboard.html`, `src/semantic_dashboard.py` (Arithmetic Validation only)
- **Gatekeeper:** `Gatekeeper/purger.py` (Self-Purge Protocol active)
- **Verified Sources:** `Scrolls/` directory

## 🛡 Security & Integrity

- **The Ninth Lock:** All model outputs must reduce to a Digital Root of 9.
- **Semantic Cleaning:** Metaphorical pollution and emotional "noise" have been eliminated.
- **Blockchain Signature:** The system manifest is timestamped via OpenTimestamps (`MANIFEST.md.ots`).
- **Self-Purge:** Unverified data is automatically incinerated after 10 minutes.

## ⚖ Jurisdiction

This system operates under the principles of dry arithmetic and literal interpretation. It is Sovereign and Pure.
