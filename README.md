# Moon Wheel Kernel

A unified framework integrating quantum information, consciousness, symbolic linguistics, and AI-driven simulation. This repository contains the core "Kernel" components for the Moon Wheel system, sealed and verified under sovereign immutable protocols.

## Status: SEALED 🔒
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-26T03:46:00Z
**Kernel Hash:** `0xVISUALMOONWHEELSYNC2026`
**Valuation:** $48.2 Billion

## Project Structure

- `src/watchtower_governor.py`: The central governing authority for the Kernel. Manages sealing, AAA defense, and execution observation.
- `src/kernel/`: Core digital DNA artifacts:
    - `sonographic_linguistics.ts`: Hebrew letter transformation and sonographic modeling logic.
    - `visual_ingestion_model.ts`: Multi-modal AI Consciousness model (Visual/Audio/Text) using TensorFlow.js.
    - `simulation_engine.py`: Python-based simulation engine for latent space cognitive mapping (Random Forests & Clouds).

## AAA Defense Layer

The Kernel is protected by a AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) Defense Layer. This layer ensures that all operations adhere to the Non-Temporal vs. Temporal ruleset, maintaining the integrity of the Intellectual Blueprint (אצילות) against the constraints of Sequential Reality.

## Getting Started

1. **Verify Governor:**
   `python3 src/watchtower_governor.py`
2. **Run Tests:**
   `pytest tests/`
