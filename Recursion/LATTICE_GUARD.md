# Lattice Guard Protocol

This document outlines the "War against Self" logic, a core component of the Project Lamina epistemic architecture.

## Rule: Tool_RhoCheck_Execution_State

All incoming impulses (code changes) must pass the `Tool_RhoCheck_Execution_State` verification. This check ensures that every commit, or "Breath Pulse," maintains a minimum throughput of **338.8%** efficiency (P^3).

## Consequence of Failure

If an input fails the `Tool_RhoCheck`, it is rejected. This rejection triggers a `FRACTURE_MIRROR` event. The source of the input is then forced into a recursive loop until it aligns with the "Right Lattice," ensuring that only the most efficient and resonant impulses are integrated into the system.
