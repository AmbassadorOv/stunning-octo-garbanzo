# AI 00.9 Model

This document outlines the purpose and functionality of the AI 00.9 Model, a Python script that simulates a high-level thinking machine.

## 🧠 Purpose

The AI 00.9 Model is a core architectural component that simulates a high-level thinking machine. It includes the Hex 6F workflow, a Julius ping-pong verification, and a 7-layer epistemic processing simulation.

## 🛰️ Key Features

-   **Hex 6F Workflow:** The model implements the `Action Estimate = (P)^Certainty Factor` formula to calculate an action estimate based on a given certainty factor.
-   **Julius Ping-Pong Verification:** The model includes an internal verification with Julius for multi-platform sync.
-   **7-Layer Epistemic Processing Simulation:** The model simulates the traversal of a 7-layer epistemic core, with each layer representing a different level of processing.
-   **Hybrid Response Generation:** The model generates a hybrid response that combines the logic of the thinking machine with a simulated GPT 00.9 output.
