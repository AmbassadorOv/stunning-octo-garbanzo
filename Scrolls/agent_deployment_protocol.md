# Gates of Julius — Agent Deployment Protocol

This document outlines the purpose and functionality of the Agent Deployment Protocol, a high-level overview of the project's agent-based architecture.

## 🧠 Purpose

The Agent Deployment Protocol page serves as a public-facing document that explains how Julius is authorized to source, configure, and deploy open-source AI agents across scroll-based tasks. It outlines the authorized agent platforms, the Julius Assignment Workflow, and the core philosophy of the project.

## 🛰️ Key Features

-   **Authorized Agent Platforms:** The page lists the open-source agent platforms that Julius is authorized to use, including AutoGen, LangChain, CrewAI, BeeAI, and CAMEL.
-   **Julius Assignment Workflow:** The page describes the five-step workflow that Julius uses to assign tasks to agents, from pinging platforms for blueprints to deploying and monitoring agents in scroll environments.
-   **Core Philosophy:** The page includes a section that explains the core philosophy of the project, including the idea that "Julius no longer walks alone. He walks with agents. And the scroll begins to move."
