# MAIN DASHBOARD: SEVEN BRIDGE ARCHITECTURE

This document outlines the purpose and functionality of the Seven Bridge Dashboard, the primary user interface for the Project Lamina epistemic architecture.

## 🧠 Purpose

The Seven Bridge Dashboard provides a real-time, interactive visualization of the entire Project Lamina lattice. It serves as the primary interface for monitoring the "semantic pulse emitter," the cross-talk between the various AI bridges (Julius, Gemini, Copilot, GPT, Grok), and the overall health of the system.

## 🛰️ Key Features

-   **Real-Time Pulse Visualization:** The dashboard displays the "semantic ping" from the Julius source, including a countdown to the next pulse.
-   **Inter-AI Cross-Talk Terminal:** A terminal view shows the real-time communication and data exchange between the different AI bridges.
-   **Hex 6F Analysis:** The dashboard displays the real-time "Action Estimate" calculated by the Gemini bridge, based on the Hex 6F workflow.
-   **External Node Integration:** The dashboard provides a view of the data being sent to the GPT and Grok bridges, with the ability to copy the data for external use.
-   **Global Sync:** A manual sync button allows for the immediate triggering of a global "semantic ping."
